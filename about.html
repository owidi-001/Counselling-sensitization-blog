                <h2>My Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Kelly Stadlin, and I am a Journalism student at Texas Christian
                    University in Fort Worth, Texas. I am originally from Tiburon, California
                    which is just outside of San Francisco. I work at a non-profit based out of
                    California that supports people with disabilities called Integrated
                    Community Services. Outside of school, I enjoy working out, spending
                    time outdoors, and talking to friends and family.

                <p>
                    As I said, I chose to go to a smaller private university as opposed to a big
                    state school largely because my parents thought I would get moreguidance and assistance in making
                    decisions about my major and classes.
                    My counseling experience at TCU has not met the high standard that
                    should be expected based on tuition and advertising. As a student who
                    struggled finding the right major, I think a counselor with a greater
                    knowledge of my interests and skills would have really helped guide me
                    down the right path.
