                        <p>TCU would benefit from implementing better counseling programs in the
                            Bob Schieffer College of Communication. Having a more universal
                            outline for counselors would help this issue tremendously. Additionally,
                            having counselors make more personal connections with students would
                            allow students to feel more supported. Parents, students, teachers,
                            administrators, business community members, and higher educationofficials must cooperate in developing an action plan. Thus, it is not just
                            up to the counselors to improve their services at TCU, but also the other
                            members of the community. Administration at the university must together
                            identify gaps in counseling - and compose a plan to create solutions.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>TCU would likely like to know that students feel they are advertising one
                            thing, but not getting what they paid for. If it got out to prospective
                            students it could sway their decision. Thus, TCU would benefit from
                            implementing better counseling programs in the Bob Schieffer College of
                            Communication. Having a more universal outline for counselors would
                            help this issue tremendously. Additionally, having counselors make more
                            personal connections with students would allow students to feel more
                            supported.</p>
