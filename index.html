                <p>
                    TCU lacks sufficient counselor support despite it being an expensive,
                    private university. Many students have shared that they felt their upper
                    level counselor after Freshman year lacked the knowledge that would have
                    been helpful in planning out their college experience more thoughtfully.
                    Some feel that their counselors fail to get to know their students, and thus
                    make it hard to make a personal connection. This website addresses this
                    issue, discussing how TCU needs to change the way they handle
                    counseling to provide the more hands on approach that they advertise.
