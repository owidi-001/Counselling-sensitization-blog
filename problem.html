                <h2>Deeper illustration of the issue</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Young, college aged adults are not commonly known for their coolheaded
                            decision-making, yet they face hundreds of choices with significant
                            long-term consequences. In school, they must decide which courses to
                            take, how much effort to invest, and what they want their career to be.
                            Many understandably lack the information and capacity needed to
                            navigate such complex options.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Enter the college counselor. College counselors have the opportunity to
                            help guide students towards their career path, take relevant courses in
                            college and assist with the student experience as a whole. However, many
                            students feel counselors at TCU are failing to do this. Instead, students,
                            specifically in the Bob Schieffer College of Communication, feel that they
                            are not getting the support they need from their counselors. Many students
                            have specifically expressed that they felt their upper level counselor after
                            Freshman year lacked the knowledge that would have been helpful in
                            planning out their college experience more thoughtfully. Some feel that
                            their counselors fail to get to know their students, and thus make it hard to
                            make a personal connection. Without this personal connection, students
                            are forced to look elsewhere for answers to their questions.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Personal</h4>
                        <p>I chose to go to a smaller private university as opposed to a big
                            state school largely because my parents thought I would get more
                            guidance and assistance in making decisions about my major andclasses. While TCU is great in
                            so many aspects, I feel that
                            counseling is something that falls short. I think TCU would be
                            inclined to fix this because they truly want to provide the best
                            experience possible for their students.</p>
                        <p>
                            As a Journalism major, counseling at TCU does not meet the high
                            standard that should be expected based on tuition and advertising. I
                            am not the only student who feels like they could have benefitted
                            from a more personal counseling experience. As a student who
                            struggled finding the right major, I think a counselor with a greater
                            knowledge of my interests and skills would have really helped
                            guide me down the right path, and I am sure there are plenty of
                            other students who also feel this way.

                        <h4>Interviews</h4>
                        <p>Strategic communication student Kaleigh Sinnott echoes the
                            feeling of students all throughout the Bob Scheiffer College of
                            Communication who feel that they are not receiving the support
                            from counselors that they need. Kaleigh shared, “I have had to
                            reach out to my counselor three times before being able to
                            schedule a meeting. My counselor makes my questions feel like a
                            burden which makes me hesitant to reach out for help, only making
                            it harder to know what classes I need to and can take as a Strategic
                            Communications student.”</p>

                    TCU is currently not making many efforts to solve this issue. The
                    university has plenty of great counselors in other departments, but needs to
                    address the issue within the Bob Schieffer College of Communication.
